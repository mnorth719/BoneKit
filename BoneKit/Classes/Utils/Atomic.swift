/**
 This Generic Type provides a wrapper that will mutex around its internal value.
 Similarly to ObjC's Atomic properties, using this class will provide
 atomic access to that property. This does come at a slight cost, as creating
 a mutex has a resource cost.
 
 
 ## Declaration:
 
 var safeInt = Atomic`<`Int`>`(10)
 
 ## Usage:
 safeInt.value = 55
 
 
 `-` or `-`
 
 
 Using the custom operators << and >>
 
 safeInt << 55
 55 >> safeInt
